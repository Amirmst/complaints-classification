    "\n",
    "According to the Injustice at Work Center, each attribute is defined as follows:\n",

    "- Unique ID: unique identifier for each case (a case is a collection of related charges)\n",
    "- State Code: complainant state\n",
    "- No of Employees Code: code indicating the approximate number of employees working for respondent employer\n",
    "- No of Employees: approximate number of employees working for respondent employer\n",
    "- NAICS Code: North American Industry Classification System code of respondent employer\n",
    "- NAICS Description: North American Industry Classification System description of respondent company (e.g., crude petroleum and natural gas extraction)\n",
    "- Institution Type Code: classification code of respondent employer\n",
    "- Institution Type: classification of respondent employer (e.g., private employer)\n",

    "## Grouping of Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the full dataset, the feature closure_code had 13 possible codes that described the outcome of each complaint. We needed to group these into two distinct classes for the purposes of our data.  We grouped these 13 codes into representing class 0 (not in favor of complainant), class 1 (in favor of complainants), or belonging to neither of these classes because it did not end clearly in favor of either group. If the case did not end clearly in favor of the complainant or employer based on the content of the case (i.e legal reasons like no jurisdiction for EEOC, case filed outside of the correct time range, etc), we labelled this as class 3 and did not include the cases in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We determined this grouping by using the following guide to show explanations of the codes meaning: https://www.umass.edu/eeodatanet/sites/default/files/IMS%20Codes.pdf\n",
    "Further explanation on terminology can be found here: https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/definitions.cfm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 0 (in favor of employer) codes: \n",
    "- M3 - No cause finding issued\n",
    "- M5 - Conciliation failure\n",
    "- X7 - Closed due to court decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 1 (in favor of employee) codes:\n",
    "- M1 - Withdrawal with benefits\n",
    "- M2 - Settlement with Benefits\n",
    "- M4 - Successful Conciliation\n",
    "- X1 - CP Filed Suit\n",
    "\n",
    "Codes that fit into neither category (class 3, but will be discarded for analysis):\n",
    "- X3 - Respondent Bankruptcy\n",
    "- X9 - ADEA Sect 7(D) Closure\n",
    "- Y1 - No Jurisdiction\n",
    "- N2 - NRTS issues at CP Request (a Right To Sue letter is issued when the agency cannot determine whether the employer discriminated against an employee)\n",
