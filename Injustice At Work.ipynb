    "- No of Employees Code: code indicating the approximate number of employees working for respondent employer\n",
    "- No of Employees: approximate number of employees working for respondent employer\n",
    "- NAICS Code: North American Industry Classification System code of respondent employer\n",
    "- NAICS Description: North American Industry Classification System description of respondent company (e.g., crude petroleum and natural gas extraction)\n",
    "- Institution Type Code: classification code of respondent employer\n",
    "- Institution Type: classification of respondent employer (e.g., private employer)\n",
